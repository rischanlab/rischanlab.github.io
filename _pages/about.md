In 2018, I joined Data Science Research Group as a PhD student at The University of Queensland (UQ), Australia, my research interests include Data Exploration and Visualizations. I got my master's degree in computer engineering from Chonnam National University, South Korea, and a bachelor's degree in IT from Sunan Kalijaga State Islamic University, Indonesia. 

I am also interested in projects related to crypto (e.g., DeFi, Dapps, NFTs, Web3). In 2021, I started to educate Indonesian millennials and gen Z about Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Decentralized apps (Dapps), Non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
